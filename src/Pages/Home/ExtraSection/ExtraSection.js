                <p>Reselling is a viable alternative to complement and supplement a direct sales organization. They can enhance a company's reach and create valuable and very tailored solutions. Even the most efficient companies will find it virtually impossible to be all things to all people at all times and a strong resales network can help make that scenario viable.

                    In today's increasingly globalized marketplace, this link becomes even more important. A network of resellers often has greater ability to offer face-to-face service. With resellers in key geographic areas and verticals, companies can service customers on a level that would be difficult or even impossible for a traditional office based sales force. The Role of resellers

                    Many customers especially in retail and hospitality are focused on what they do best and the fine intricacies of leveraging new technology can often take a back seat. Resellers have that technical expertise and experience to provide face to face, bespoke solutions to sometimes complex situations. Resellers can become so close to the customers that can actually help drive sales, not just deliver the product. They are able to solve problems as well as identify market trends and pass this information back to the business. In many ways, they are the eyes and ears to the industry and their customers.

                    The advantage of resellers

                    Because resellers represent multiple products and companies, they can provide a tailored solution thatâ€™s feels very bespoke to the customer whilst streamlining the buying process as well. Resellers have the benefit of reducing service burdens for both the company and the user. Now more than ever before they are becoming service providers. They do not just provide products. They provide aftermarket services, cost reduction and create value by providing total solutions for their customers.
